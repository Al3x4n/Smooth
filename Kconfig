    default 512
    help
        MQTT allows messages sizes up to 268435455 bytes in its remaning lengths field which is obviously
	too much data to hold in memory on an embedded device. Any incoming message with a remaining length
	larger than the set value will be 'swallowed' by the Smooth MQTT protocol implementation and never
	seen by the application.

config SMOOTH_MAX_MQTT_OUTGOING_MESSAGES
    int "Maximum number of queued outgoing messages"
    range 5 50
    default 10
    help
        As there is a limited amount of heap memory available, the number of outgoing messages needs to be
        limited to prevent using up all memory, eventually resulting in a undefined behavior of the application.
        (Incoming messages are immediately passed to the application without any buffering so it is up to the
        application developer to handle that side.)
